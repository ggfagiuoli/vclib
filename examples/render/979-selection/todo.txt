- Face selection
- Edge selection
- Selection modes (add, subtract, invert, select all, select none)
- Figure out a proper implementation location in the c++ code
- Actual way to "start selecting"
- Check Z coordinate in selection if (needs to be inside the NDC space)
- Maybe change code so that the selection box uniform is already in NDC space?

- Non penetrating selection, possible ways:
    1. Depth buffer interpolation
        1. Calculate Depth Buffer (framebuffer)
        2. Calculate position of point in screen space
        3. Interpolate bilinearly the depth value within (pSS.x - 0.5, pSS.y - 0.5) and (pSS.x + 0.5, pSS.y + 0.5) 
        (Likely done automatically when reading the texture) 
        (Transform those coordinates in texture space, right now they are in Screen Space)
        (If possible ignore values equal to one (unless the others are near it), because there's likely nothing there)
        4. If point depth (NDC) is within an epsilon of said depth, it is visible; otherwise it isn't
        5. Select the points that are visible and that are within the selection box
