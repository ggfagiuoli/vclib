- Face selection
- Edge selection
- Selection modes (add, subtract, invert, select all, select none)
- Figure out a proper implementation location in the c++ code
- Actual way to "start selecting"
- Check Z coordinate in selection if (needs to be inside the NDC space)
- Maybe change code so that the selection box uniform is already in NDC space?
