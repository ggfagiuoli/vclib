- Face selection
- Edge selection
- Selection modes (add, subtract, invert, select all, select none)
- Figure out a proper implementation location in the c++ code
- Actual way to "start selecting"

URGENT:
- Clean up texture (which is now useless, given the vertex and fragment shaders to show the selection)
